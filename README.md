**_A chrome extension to automatically load, read and dynamically filter tweets._**

New tweets are filtered according to your criteria, then listed (in real time) in a specially created tab.  As the tweets are listed in the new tab, they are coloured green in the twitter.com page.  Older tweets are coloured red.  As a demonstration, the first tweet is immediately made green, and immediately listed if the criteria are met.

There is also a memory feature: the output tweets from a previous run are shown in another new tab.  If memory is stored, a prompt box offers you the chance to clear memory at the start of the new run.

To use: be on a twitter tweet tab.  In the prompt box, type what string you require to be in your selected tweets.  Only these tweets will appear in the output tab.
